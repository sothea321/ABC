I'm a junior in college.

Just like my name implies,

I'm surrounded by lots of happiness every day.

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:29.952
I was born on Strawberry Day, January 5th.

00:00:29.953 --> 00:00:32.589
I love strawberry crepes.

00:00:33.505 --> 00:00:35.929
I hate bugs and green peppers.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.952
My hobby is exercising,

00:00:37.953 --> 00:00:41.256
and I get along with people easily.

I'm looking for love.

00:00:44.785 --> 00:00:47.417
I want someone kind and honest.

I'm sure I'll meet some great friends

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.380

It's true I was born on Strawberry Day,

but I'm always the one who gets the bug-infested strawberry.

So sour!

00:01:54.256 --> 00:01:57.854
I love beer and fried dumplings.

00:02:01.123 --> 00:02:03.644
But even though it's my favorite,

00:02:03.645 --> 00:02:07.194
I can't let my guard down.

00:02:17.205 --> 00:02:20.159

I've always had unnatural, unreasonable showers of bad luck.

And I've finally come to this conclusion.

I'm just meant to be unlucky.

In that case, how do we define "heart"?

Well...

"Haven't changed"?

00:10:48.577 --> 00:10:50.756
You see, I failed German last year,

00:10:50.757 --> 00:10:53.457
so I was in his class at the other campus last year.

00:10:53.458 --> 00:10:56.905
And the girls I liked were all head over heels for him.

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:58.570
I didn't do anything.

00:10:58.571 --> 00:11:00.577
Yeah, I know that.

00:11:00.578 --> 00:11:03.114
You super lucky guy.

00:11:03.114 --> 00:11:04.711
Super lucky?

00:11:04.712 --> 00:11:07.637
Yeah. This guy's overflowing with good luck.

00:11:07.637 --> 00:11:10.695
He always wins a good prize in a lottery,

00:11:10.696 --> 00:11:13.966
and he can always buy rare tickets.

00:11:13.966 --> 00:11:15.588
What?

00:11:15.589 --> 00:11:19.011
And vending machines always give him extras.

00:11:20.105 --> 00:11:22.680
When I buy vending machine drinks,

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.340
extras are the least of my worries.

00:11:26.565 --> 00:11:30.950
I don't even get the drink I paid for.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.276
What?

00:11:32.277 --> 00:11:36.317
Anyway, whenever he's involved, everything always goes well.

00:11:36.317 --> 00:11:38.614
It's just a coincidence.

00:11:38.614 --> 00:11:40.220
I'm so jealous.

00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:42.449
I'm so envious.

00:11:42.449 --> 00:11:45.879
A super lucky guy? What the hell?

00:11:47.433 --> 00:11:49.910
Attention, please!

00:11:49.911 --> 00:11:53.101
As per seminar tradition,

00:11:53.101 --> 00:11:59.075
it's time for the introduction game! You gotta hit exactly one minute!

00:11:59.076 --> 00:12:01.842
Seriously?

00:12:01.842 --> 00:12:05.371
Okay, who's going to go first?

00:12:05.372 --> 00:12:07.626
Let's start with you, Tsujimura.

00:12:08.732 --> 00:12:11.275
Come over here.

00:12:11.275 --> 00:12:12.700
Come on. Come on.

00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:13.922
No way, seriously?

00:12:13.922 --> 00:12:15.137
Turn and face everyone.

00:12:15.138 --> 00:12:17.169
I don't really know what to say.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:17.974
Ready?

00:12:17.975 --> 00:12:19.856
Okay, begin.

00:12:19.857 --> 00:12:22.783
Let me see... I'm Saku Tsujimura.

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:27.419
Um... I've known Naoya and Mugi since high school.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.027
Um... I guess that's it.

00:12:30.028 --> 00:12:31.594
Done.

00:12:31.594 --> 00:12:34.618
Finished? That was only 13 seconds.

00:12:34.619 --> 00:12:39.399
- Okay, I'll go next.
- Oh, no problem.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.819
I'm Mugi Sasaki. I love fashion.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.293
I work part-time at the thrift store near the station, so come visit.

00:12:46.293 --> 00:12:50.340
Let's eat, drink, and find girlfriends tonight!

00:12:50.341 --> 00:12:51.538
Done.

00:12:51.539 --> 00:12:54.380
Close! That was 52 seconds.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:58.745
My dream is to become a counselor. That's it.

00:12:58.745 --> 00:13:00.197
63 seconds.

00:13:00.198 --> 00:13:02.998
What?

00:13:02.998 --> 00:13:06.525
I'm Naoya Shinomiya. My hobby is exercising.

00:13:06.525 --> 00:13:10.481
I do muscle training three times a week.

00:13:10.482 --> 00:13:16.145
And I'm a fan of leather clothes, so I collect them.

00:13:16.146 --> 00:13:20.537
That's all from me. Thanks for listening.

00:13:20.537 --> 00:13:23.623
Wow, that's exactly one minute.

00:13:23.624 --> 00:13:25.395
- Amazing!
- For real?

00:13:25.396 --> 00:13:26.699
So lucky!

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.981
What a super lucky guy!

00:13:27.982 --> 00:13:29.454
- Really?
- Look.

00:13:29.454 --> 00:13:30.997
You're right.

00:13:30.998 --> 00:13:34.446
Please just give me a bit of your luck.

00:13:34.447 --> 00:13:36.521
Nice!

00:13:37.322 --> 00:13:41.201
And that leaves us with Kota.

00:13:41.201 --> 00:13:43.849
Give it to me. This is just unfair.

00:13:43.849 --> 00:13:45.228
Fukuhara, come on.

00:13:45.229 --> 00:13:47.482
Kota, your turn.

00:13:54.531 --> 00:13:57.277
Hey, Kota?

00:13:57.277 --> 00:14:00.109
Hey, Kota.

00:14:00.109 --> 00:14:02.921
Kota.

00:14:02.921 --> 00:14:04.947
It's your turn.

00:14:04.947 --> 00:14:06.905
What? Oh, okay.

00:14:06.905 --> 00:14:08.487
- What was that?
- Sorry.

00:14:08.488 --> 00:14:11.359
I think I'm a bit drunk. I'm sorry.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.708
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

00:14:12.709 --> 00:14:15.208
Okay, our final introduction.

00:14:15.209 --> 00:14:17.009
It's all yours, Kota.

00:14:17.009 --> 00:14:20.750
Hello, I'm Kota Fukuhara.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:24.497
My birthday is Strawberry Day, January 5th.

00:14:24.497 --> 00:14:29.521
I love strawberry crepes, and I hate...

00:14:38.298 --> 00:14:40.474
Let me think...

00:14:41.513 --> 00:14:43.244
- What was it?
- What?

00:14:43.244 --> 00:14:45.439
Is it a quiz? Wait, let me think.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.937
Never mind, I'm done now.

00:14:47.938 --> 00:14:51.802
Too bad. It was 29 seconds.

00:14:52.794 --> 00:14:54.356
Okay, and that concludes

00:14:54.357 --> 00:15:00.997
our exactly one-minute self-introduction game. Thanks, everyone.

00:15:02.583 --> 00:15:04.231
Good work.

00:15:04.232 --> 00:15:05.371
What?

00:15:05.372 --> 00:15:07.223
Is beer okay?

00:15:07.224 --> 00:15:09.074
Oh... yes.

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:11.075
Thanks.

00:15:11.075 --> 00:15:14.475
How did he know I wanted beer?

00:15:16.177 --> 00:15:20.580
Well, I guess I can tell he's a good guy.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.794
And tonight...

00:15:30.848 --> 00:15:34.716
I had such a good time!

00:15:37.459 --> 00:15:41.348
The waiter never spilled water on me

00:15:41.349 --> 00:15:45.091
and no one threw up on me.

00:15:45.091 --> 00:15:49.793
Ah, I smell so nice. This is Heaven.

00:15:49.794 --> 00:15:50.965
Could it be?

00:15:50.966 --> 00:15:53.605
Is my bad luck...

00:16:00.654 --> 00:16:03.855
Of course, I still got it.

00:16:03.855 --> 00:16:08.329
You've been following me, haven't you? Stalker!

00:16:10.774 --> 00:16:12.911
Ouch.

00:16:14.882 --> 00:16:17.172
But still...

00:16:18.685 --> 00:16:21.203
Why so suddenly?

00:16:22.396 --> 00:16:24.622
Could it be?

00:16:29.202 --> 00:16:33.474
It wouldn't be unusual for me to break a bone there.

00:16:33.474 --> 00:16:36.074
And tonight's party, too...

00:16:36.075 --> 00:16:37.385
Beer is so good.

00:16:37.386 --> 00:16:38.360
You're cute.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.770
I'd usually get alcohol, soy sauce, or vomit on me

00:16:41.771 --> 00:16:44.054
and have to go through hell.

00:16:44.054 --> 00:16:46.466
You're seriously cute.

00:16:47.895 --> 00:16:49.995
Could it be?

00:16:52.164 --> 00:16:54.788
Was my bad luck repelled

00:16:54.788 --> 00:16:56.688
by that guy?

00:16:59.285 --> 00:17:03.182
Naoya, can I get your number?

00:17:03.182 --> 00:17:04.968
Yeah, sure.

00:17:04.968 --> 00:17:06.067
- Really?
- Me, too.

00:17:06.068 --> 00:17:07.623
- Do you want mine, too?
- No, thanks.

00:17:07.623 --> 00:17:09.613
Don't be shy.

00:17:09.613 --> 00:17:10.387
- You don't want it?
- I'm so happy.

00:17:10.388 --> 00:17:11.514
Hey...

00:17:11.514 --> 00:17:13.489
Oh, it's Kota.

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:18.124
Can I talk to Naoya for a second?

00:17:18.124 --> 00:17:20.579
- Naoya?
- Sure.

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:22.522
Sorry, excuse me.

00:17:22.523 --> 00:17:24.718
Hey, come back soon. Okay?

00:17:24.719 --> 00:17:25.990
Sorry.

00:17:25.991 --> 00:17:27.791
Bye-bye.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:32.443
That was crazy back there.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:35.489
Thanks for the help.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:36.432
So, what is it?

00:17:36.432 --> 00:17:41.549
Well, the only person I know on this campus is you,

00:17:41.549 --> 00:17:45.069
so I was wondering if we could tour the place together.

00:17:45.069 --> 00:17:47.660
Oh, that's it?

00:17:47.661 --> 00:17:49.006
Sure thing.

00:17:49.006 --> 00:17:51.918
Really? I'm so glad.

00:17:51.918 --> 00:17:54.293
Where should we go?

00:17:54.294 --> 00:17:56.887
I got you now, my attractive Naoya.

00:17:56.888 --> 00:18:03.043
I'll investigate how well you annul my bad luck today.

00:18:03.043 --> 00:18:04.910
How about the cafeteria?

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:08.181
Sure. I was actually getting a bit hungry.

00:18:08.181 --> 00:18:10.138
Let's go.

00:18:14.339 --> 00:18:15.942
[Recruiting Members| Remote Control Society]
What is that?

00:18:18.226 --> 00:18:21.048
I wasn't hit? Good luck already?

00:18:21.048 --> 00:18:23.456
You like remote control toys?

00:18:23.457 --> 00:18:25.681
Not at all.

00:18:25.681 --> 00:18:27.956
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:18:29.582 --> 00:18:33.348
No, it's still too early to tell.

00:18:33.348 --> 00:18:35.603
Wow.

00:18:38.147 --> 00:18:41.554
My chopsticks broke evenly.

00:18:44.263 --> 00:18:46.699
My noodles are usually cold and soggy.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.027
They've never tasted so good before.

00:18:52.474 --> 00:18:55.072
This coffee's great, too.

00:18:55.072 --> 00:18:56.668
Darn, this is so heavy.

00:18:56.669 --> 00:18:57.864
You like coffee, too?

00:18:57.865 --> 00:19:00.989
- Yeah.
- Oh, no.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.653
It's going to spill.

00:19:02.654 --> 00:19:07.466
Gosh, he's definitely coming my way.

00:19:10.614 --> 00:19:12.231
I'll help you.

00:19:12.232 --> 00:19:14.123
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

00:19:14.124 --> 00:19:16.124
Thanks.

00:19:17.564 --> 00:19:19.702
I didn't get splashed?

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.138
Hey, this looks interesting.

00:19:30.028 --> 00:19:32.036
It didn't hit me.

00:19:33.185 --> 00:19:36.632
Where to go next?

00:19:36.632 --> 00:19:39.171
What do I do?

00:19:39.171 --> 00:19:43.199
It turned out amazing. Thanks!

00:19:43.199 --> 00:19:44.908
What? She's not mad!

00:19:44.908 --> 00:19:46.926
It's amazing!

00:19:46.927 --> 00:19:49.243
Where should we go next?

00:19:49.243 --> 00:19:52.330
Yeah, let's see...

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.230
- Whoa!
- Kota!

00:19:55.907 --> 00:19:58.011
I didn't fall!

00:19:58.012 --> 00:19:59.904
Amazing! Amazing!

00:19:59.904 --> 00:20:03.716
This is great!

00:20:06.536 --> 00:20:08.288
Huh? What?

00:20:08.288 --> 00:20:09.699
Sorry.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.699
I've been keeping it in,

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.820
but Kota, your eyes are shining.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.130
Oops.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:22.256
But... this was really fun.

00:20:27.739 --> 00:20:30.122
You're pretty cute.

00:20:32.369 --> 00:20:34.069
Like a puppy.

00:20:35.848 --> 00:20:39.150
A... A puppy?

00:20:40.324 --> 00:20:43.824
I'm not.

00:20:43.824 --> 00:20:45.675
What a formidable guy.

00:20:45.675 --> 00:20:50.080
Anyone would fall for him after hearing such words from that face.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:54.208
He doesn't know he's a lady-killer.

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:57.699
This is dangerous.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.184
If I hang with him,

00:20:59.185 --> 00:21:03.680
there's going to be a blood bath eventually.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.656
What?

00:21:05.656 --> 00:21:08.403
No, it's nothing.

00:21:08.404 --> 00:21:09.605
Let's go.

00:21:09.605 --> 00:21:11.005
Sure.

00:21:14.475 --> 00:21:18.583
But it's hard to give up his effect on my bad luck.

00:21:18.583 --> 00:21:22.857
Um... Naoya.

00:21:22.857 --> 00:21:27.471
Naoya, I have something else I want to talk about.

00:21:27.471 --> 00:21:28.805
Okay.

00:21:31.738 --> 00:21:35.847
If I want to use this guy and his good luck,

00:21:35.847 --> 00:21:38.793
I'll have to...

00:21:40.239 --> 00:21:43.505
I was hoping we could stay together always.

00:21:47.405 --> 00:21:49.405
No?

00:21:51.964 --> 00:21:56.168
Wait, did I mess up?

00:21:59.006 --> 00:22:00.606
Sure.

00:22:01.754 --> 00:22:03.554
What?

00:22:03.554 --> 00:22:06.182
Okay, let's stay together.

00:22:06.182 --> 00:22:08.655
All right!

00:22:08.655 --> 00:22:12.073
Really? Thanks...

00:22:36.505 --> 00:22:38.005
What?

00:22:38.769 --> 00:22:42.110
Just now...

00:22:43.129 --> 00:22:44.429
What?

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.580
Couples normally kiss, right?

00:22:48.246 --> 00:22:49.746
What?

00:22:50.811 --> 00:22:52.911
Now we're dating.

00:22:55.564 --> 00:23:00.968
What?! That's not what I meant though!

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:12.180

Who's dating Naoya?

00:23:47.061 --> 00:23:48.127
Let's go together.

00:23:48.128 --> 00:23:50.101
Naoya and I...

00:23:50.101 --> 00:23:51.846
Then we can be together all day.

00:23:51.846 --> 00:23:52.967
Naoya!

00:23:52.967 --> 00:23:55.040
I can't let my partner catch a cold.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.653
I'm really sorry.

00:23:57.653 --> 00:24:00.053
It was my fault.
